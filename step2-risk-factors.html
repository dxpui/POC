            <p>
                Messaging services allow users to protect their privacy. If your service is a messaging service, you should consider how this can play a role in children encountering CHC in a setting that is hidden from public view. Our evidence indicates that this can result in more targeted harmful behaviour, such as bullying content, and make detection more difficult. This can be particularly for messaging services with encrypted and ephemeral messaging, which may be more likely to be used by children sharing violent content.

                                            There is evidence of foreign interference offences and influence operations occurring across many different service types using different tactics.

They may also assist in the production and publication of animal cruelty content, or share it via the messaging services.

            <p>
                If your service allows users to create a user profile that displays identifying information that can be viewed by others (e.g. images, usernames, age), we expect you to take account of the risks that can arise from this. For example, our evidence indicates that children can see users (e.g. ‘influencers’) with a significant number of user connections displayed on their user profiles as trusted sources of information, creating a heightened risk of harm if eating disorder content is shared from these accounts. Children can also display pro-eating disorder information on their user profile, such as in their username, which can contribute to them receiving recommendations for eating disorder content and facilitate the creation of networks with other pro-eating disorder users.

            <p>
                User connections can allow children to build networks and help bolster the credibility of users that share CHC. They can also play a role in children being contacted as users sometimes must be connected to message one another. Our evidence shows that children can often be sent pornographic content by users who they are connected with but do not know. Children can also be connected to users that are known to share CHC such as self-harm content. This makes such content easier to find and helps create networks of users in which CHC such as online challenges and violent content can go ‘viral,’ especially when users are connected in large numbers. As mentioned in user profiles, children can perceive accounts with a large number of connections displayed on their profile as an indicator of trust.

Diaspora groups may be targeted for foreign influence operations. It may be possible that the display of profile information which would enable other users to identify members of these groups (for example, information about language spoken or home town) could also increase the risks of harm to these diaspora groups.
