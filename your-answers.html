                                                Many social media services are designed to maximise engagement between
                                                users. If your service is a social media service, you should consider
                                                how potential perpetrators may exploit this design for illegal purposes.
                                                For example, potential perpetrators may exploit the likelihood of
                                                virality to share illegal content with very large groups of people.
                                                Social media services can also be used by potential perpetrators of
                                                grooming to target young users by sending out many messages. These
                                                services are also used in large-scale foreign interference campaigns to
                                                spread disinformation. Research shows that social media services can
                                                increase the risk of all kinds of illegal harm. This may be due to more
                                                research on social media services, or greater probability of risk due to
                                                the wide range of functionalities and features on many social media
                                                services.

                                                Messaging services allow users to protect their privacy. If your service
                                                is a messaging service, you should consider how this design may also be
                                                used by potential perpetrators to communicate and share illegal content
                                                in a setting that is hidden from public view. This can result in more
                                                targeted behaviours and can make detection more difficult, particularly
                                                on messaging services with encryption. If you have encrypted messaging
                                                on your service, you should refer to the Risk Profile for encrypted
                                                messaging because encryption can make detection more difficult.
                                                Potential perpetrators often seek to move other users from services
                                                where they initially connected to messaging services. If you allow users
                                                to follow or subscribe to other users on your service, you should refer
                                                to the Risk Profile for user connections because potential perpetrators
                                                often seek to move other users from services where they initially
                                                connected (you should also read the Risk Profile on user connections) to
                                                messaging services.

                                                is shared in real-time. There is a substantial evidence base detailing
                                                the role that livestreaming plays in the commission of sexual abuse and
                                                exploitation of children. There is also evidence to suggest that
                                                comments on livestreams are used to facilitate grooming offences

                                                livestreaming of child sexual exploitation and abuse can be used to
                                                create child sexual abuse material. This functionality can also be used
                                                to broadcast terror attacks, often on open channels which can similarly
                                                be circulated to wider audiences if captured or recorded, therefore you

                                                allow users to find illegal content and identify users to target on your
                                                service. For example, fraudsters may post content relating to the supply
                                                of stolen bank details or money alongside advice on how to use them to
