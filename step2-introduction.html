                  <p>The next step towards completing your children’s risk assessment is to assess the risk of harm to children from encountering each kind of content harmful to children (CHC). Online services not compliant with the Online Safety Act 2023 can be subject to significant fines and other penalties and may be putting users and the service at risk.
                   </p>
  
                  <p>The risk factors you identified in the previous step provide a starting point, but now you need to consider evidence about the kinds of CHC on your specific service and use this to make a judgement of the level of risk. The aim is to help you complete a children’s risk assessment that is suitable and sufficient as required by the law.
                  </p>
  
  
                  <h2>An overview of this step</h2>

                  </p>
				  
                  <h3>Assess evidence of risk on your service</h3>
                  <p class="fs-14">We list the types of evidence that you need to gather You will need to consider types of evidence that you already hold so that you can assess the risk of harm to children on your service. You will use this information to assess the likelihood and potential impact of children encountering each kind of CHC.
                  </p>

                  <h3>Assign a level of risk for each kind of content harmful to children</h3>
                  <p class="fs-14">Use the evidence you’ve gathered to make a judgement of the risk level of each kind of CHC on your service. You will then assign an overall risk level of negligible, low, medium, or high to each kind of CHC.
                  </p>

                  <h3>Record your decisions about risk and the reasons for them</h3>
                  <p class="fs-14">You will need to record your decisions about the level of risk you have assigned and keep a list of evidence you have referred to when making your decision. You can use our template to help you record your decisions. <br />
