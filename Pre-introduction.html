                <div>
                  <p class="fs-16">The next stop of your risk assessment is to assess how each kind of illegal harm could take
                    place on your service. The risk factors you identified in the previous step provide a starting point,
                    but now you need to consider evidence about harm on your specific service and make a judgement of the level of risk.
                   </p>
  
                  <p class="fs-14">Step 2 is divided into four sections to help you work through
                    all the information you need to properly assess your risks and harms. They are:
                  </p>
  
                  <ul>
                    <li class="mt-3">Understand the illegal harms and your risk factors.</li>
                    <li class="mt-3">Assess evidence about your service.</li>
                    <li class="mt-3"> Assign a level of risk for each kind of warm.</li>
                    <li class="mt-3">Record your decisions about risk  and the reasons for the them.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
  
                  <p class="fs-14">We will provide you with a list of the risk  factors relevant to your service based on the information 
                    you provided in step 1 of this tool.
                  </p>
  
                  <h2>Who should use this tool</h2>
                  <p class="fs-14">Someone who understands the evidence about risk on your service and can analyse evidence to access 
                    the harms accurately. You should also involve any relevant experts within your organisation.
                  </p>
  
                  <h2>Before you start </h2>
                  <p class="fs-14">This is likely to be the most time-consuming part of carrying out your risk assessment. You should be prepared to gather and analyse information about your service, so you can assess each of the 18 kinds of illegal harm individually. You need to make a decision on the likelihood and potential impact of each harm on your service, and assign a risk level of low, medium, high or negligible.
                  </p>
  
                  <p class="fs-14">This step will take you through Ofcom’s guidance on how to identify any additional risk factors, what evidence to consider, how to analyse the information available, and how to make your decisions about risk. The aim is to help you complete a risk assessment that is “suitable and sufficient” as required by the law.
                  </p>
  
                  <p class="fs-14">You need to record this information and you can use our template to help.
                  </p>
  
                  <p class="fs-14">You must complete your first illegal content risk assessment by [DATE] (3 months after we publish our final guidance). If you start a new service after [DATE] or change an existing service so that the Act now applies to this, you must complete your risk assessment within three months from when you started or changed the service. Online services not compliant with the Online Safety Act 2023 can be subject to significant fines and other penalties, may be putting users and the service at risk.
                  </p>
  
                  <h2>How long this will take</h2>
                  <p class="fs-14">The reading time for this step is 1-2 hours. The work to complete and record your risk assessment could take several days or several weeks, depending on the size and complexity of the service. This is a key activity for your online safety compliance. You can come back to this tool any time to check our guidance.
                  </p>
  
                  <h2>The legal obligations this step can help with</h2>
                  <p class="fs-14">
                    This step will help you comply with important parts of the illegal content risk assessment duties in sections 9 and 26 of the Online Safety Act 2023. This includes your obligations to:
                  </p>
  
  
                  <ul>
                    <li class="mt-3">Assess the risk of the 18 kinds of illegal harm, including the risk of your users encountering illegal content and your service being used to commit or facilitate an illegal offence (for user-to-user services)</li>
                    <li class="mt-3">Take into account Ofcom’s risk profiles in your risk assessment.</li>
                    <li class="mt-3"> Assess key characteristics of your service including its user base, functionalities, algorithms, the way it is used, and other aspects of its design and operation (including the business model, governance, use of proactive technology, measures to promote users’ media literacy and safe use of the service, and other systems and processes).</li>
                    <li class="mt-3">Assess the likelihood and impact of illegal harm (including the level of risk and the nature and severity of harm that could occur)</li>
                    <li class="mt-3">Overall, carry a suitable and sufficient risk assessment for your service</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p class="fs-14">
                    This step will also help you comply with your record keeping and review duties in section 23 and 34 of the Act.
